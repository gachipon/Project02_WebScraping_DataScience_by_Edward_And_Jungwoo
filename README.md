# Project02_WebScraping_DataScience_by_Edward_And_Jungwoo
Web scraping and Data science for McDonalds Breakfast

To start off, you need pandas, numpy and matplotlib, so in the terminal

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib requests_html

This should give you the libraries you need to run the rest of the code.

The proper flow for our project would be:

1. Run Project02.py
2. Run through the python notebook file Project02Plots.ipynb
3. Run through the python notebook file McDonalds visualisation.ipynb

There are also some checkpoints within each file, which should allow you to run each file individually.
